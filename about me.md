About me
Hi I'm Lucas,

I was born in Argentina, I love programming. My first contacts with programming I remember it was in elementary school with Logo, then later in high school with VBA. Later I started to like it and started a course on Delphi CDs.

I left programming for a few years, I dedicated myself to study and then to work and dedicate myself to computer science, and finally, I returned to programming again learning on my own with a C and C ++ book.

Later I decided to study and learn more and started the programming technician at the National Technological University where I could learn much more about programming.

I always liked informatics and computing and everything related, I studied networks, I dedicated myself to learning Linux administration and I love to continue learning and how to automate processes.

I am always looking for new challenges, new knowledge, in that way I also did an Ethical Hacking training in which I used my knowledge in python to perform a scan of a network in search of different services in a network.

Lucas
